# binary_converter

## Description
Write a script converting from binary to decimal numbers and from decimal to binary numbers. Converter should expect two numbers in one line separate with single space. First of them is a number to covert, and the second one is information about the actual system (2 or 10). Program prints two values - converted number and information about number system after conversion (2 or 10), also separated with one space.

## Examples
Input:
<code>1010 2</code>
Output:
<code>10 10</code>

Input:
<code>4583 10</code>
Output:
<code>0001000111100111 2</code>

\*Additional feature:
Numbers after conversion are printed in formatted table, like the following one:

> /--------\\<br>
> | 10 | 2 |<br>
> \\--------/
